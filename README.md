# Robotics-Final-Project

## Robot Swarm Project Using WeBots

### Description

Our final project will use the terminal to input a command and have a group of ePuck robots perform a group action. Specifically, we are going to have the robots create shapes and figures given a voice command such as “Circle",  "Square", and "Triangle” Given these commands, the ePuck robots will create the shape as a group while avoiding collisions.
