# Robotics-Final-Project

## Robot Swarm Project Using WeBots

### Description

Our final project will use the terminal to input a command and have a group of ePuck robots perform a group action. Specifically, we are going to have the robots create shapes and figures given a voice command such as “Circle",  "Square", and "Triangle” Given these commands, the ePuck robots will create the shape as a group while avoiding collisions. If multiple shapes are proposed then the robots would hold each shape for 5 seconds before proceeding to create the next shape. A command can be given to return the robots to their starting position.
